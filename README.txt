Introduction:

Our project takes a more realistic approach to tank based combat while showcasing our team's own developed AI.  Our game features physics based projectiles, tank destruction, combat sounds, and a fast paced atmosphere that gives a challenging arcade feel.

As the focus of the project was AI, a deeper description of the AI will be discussed.  When AI tanks are spawned they hold a list of enemy tanks based on tags that are applied at spawn and during their "searching" phase they draw a raycast to all of the enemies to check if they can be "seen".  It then grabs the closest "seen" enemy and will move to their location while firing in their direction.  If the enemy goes out of sight the tank will keep moving towards their last seen position. 

Other implimented features of our game include, team and allies spawning and fighting, a soundtrack of thunderous distant fighting, a UAV styled stratigic minimap, and a beautiful start menu.

Controls are described at the start of the game.
